| **Test ID** | **Test Scenario** | **Preconditions** | **Test Steps** | **Expected Results** |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **ET1** | Network disconnects after clicking positive CTA | User is logged in, the announcement modal is displayed | 1. Click the positive CTA button <br> 2. Disconnect the network immediately after | 1. The app should show an error message or retry the action <br> 2. The user should remain on the current page or be notified of the failure to navigate |
| **ET2** | Announcement modal fails to load due to server error | User is logged in, but the server returns an error | 1. Attempt to load the announcement modal | 1.

| **ET3** | Attempt to dismiss the modal with an unresponsive UI | User is logged in, the announcement modal is visible | 1. Simulate an unresponsive UI (e.g., by freezing the app or simulating heavy load) <br> 2. Attempt to click the dismiss button | 1. The modal may not dismiss immediately <br> 2. The system should recover gracefully, either by responding after a delay or by providing feedback to the user |
| **ET4** | Click positive CTA while PEGA server is down | User is logged in, the announcement modal is visible, and PEGA server is down | 1. Click the positive CTA button | 1. The user should be redirected to the destination page <br> 2. The app should handle the PEGA feedback failure gracefully, potentially retrying later or logging the error locally |
| **ET5** | Corrupted or malformed modal data | User is logged in, but the modal data is corrupted | 1. Attempt to display the announcement modal with corrupted data | 1. The modal should fail to load properly, and an error message should be displayed <br> 2. The app should prevent any interaction with the corrupted modal and allow the user to continue using the app normally |
| **ET6** | Multiple clicks on the positive CTA in quick succession | User is logged in, the announcement modal is visible | 1. Rapidly click the positive CTA button multiple times | 1. The system should handle multiple clicks gracefully, either by processing the first click only or by preventing further clicks until the first action is complete <br> 2. No duplicate feedback should be sent to PEGA |
| **ET7** | User navigates away during the loading of the announcement modal | User is logged in, the announcement modal is in the process of loading | 1. Attempt to load the announcement modal <br> 2. Quickly navigate to another part of the app before the modal finishes loading | 1. The modal loading should be cancelled or paused <br> 2. The app should handle the incomplete action without crashing or displaying errors |
| **ET8** | Inconsistent UI behavior due to device orientation change | User is logged in, the announcement modal is visible | 1. Change the device orientation (e.g., from portrait to landscape) while the modal is visible | 1. The modal should adjust its layout to fit the new orientation <br> 2. No UI elements should become unresponsive or misaligned |
| **ET9** | Display modal with insufficient device memory | User is logged in, but the device is low on memory | 1. Attempt to load the announcement modal on a device with low memory | 1. The app should manage memory efficiently, potentially showing a warning if the modal cannot load <br> 2. The app should prevent crashes and allow the user to continue using the app |
| **ET10** | Unexpected app termination during modal interaction | User is logged in, the announcement modal is visible | 1. Interact with the announcement modal (e.g., click buttons) <br> 2. Simulate an unexpected app termination (e.g., force close) | 1. Upon reopening the app, the modal should either resume its previous state or be dismissed properly <br> 2. The app should handle the termination gracefully, without losing critical user data or state
